# Return-YouTube-Dislike-API.py

Credits for the API go to the maintainers of *https://returnyoutubedislike.com*

All I did was make a script to show the information in a cleaner way.


To use just run

```bash
python YT-API.py
```
and put the vcode of the YouTube URL when asked.

An example of the vcode would be the numbers after the v= in a youtube link. So it'd basically look like this `Y2DNwLVZECM`
